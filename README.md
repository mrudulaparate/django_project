## Employee Management System
This is a project done using Django web development framewrok which is python based.

For the front end I have used HTML and CSS, particularly Bootstrap framework to make the site look more attractive.


The project has 4 pages namely:
1. Home page
2. Add employee
3. Delete employee
4. search employee

All the pages are made responsive and i have include a button for back tracking to the home page.
